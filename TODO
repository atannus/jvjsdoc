- what to do about the absolute paths in deps.js?
- clean up the code so that otheres can more easily read/modify it
- handle inline JsDoc tags
- restrict inline HTML to a safe subset (no <button>)
- explore where the stray index entries come from
- work around MacOSX's case-insensitive file names
- documentation of several functions is missing brackets
  (e.g. goog.array.indexOf)

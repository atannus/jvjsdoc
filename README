JvJsDoc - a JSDoc documentation generator for use with the closure library


   JvJsDoc is a program to extract documentation from JavaScript
source code and to present the collected information in a set of
HTML pages.  It is meant to be used together with the Google Closure
Library and the Google Closure Compiler.  Features of JvJsDoc include
the following:

- Generates one HTML page with documentation per class/namespace.
- A search box in the HTML output allows to quickly find the
  documentation for any given symbol.
- Can optionally include the Closure Library documentation into the
  output to seamlessly document methods inherited from closure
  library-provided classes etc.
- JvJsDoc is written in Python and requires Python version 3.2 or
  newer to run.

   The development of JvJsDoc is still at an early stage, and there
are still several known shortcomings of the program (e.g. inline JSDoc
comments are not yet handled), but it works well enought that it is
already useful for day-to-day work.

   Please email any suggestions and bug reports to Jochen Voss
<voss@seehuhn.de>.  Your message should include the JvJsDoc version
number, as obtained by the command 'jvjsdoc -V'.

INSTALLATION
============

   For installation of JvJsDoc you will need version 3.2 or newer of
the Python interpreter installed.  Optionally, to include documentation
of Closure Library provided symbols in the generated output, the
Closure Library JavaScript source needs to be available.

   Generic installation instructions are in the file "INSTALL".  On
most systems, the following commands should be sufficient:

	./configure
	make
	make install

   If you get the error message "no suitable Python interpreter
found", this indicates that the configure script couldn't find a
sufficently new version of Python.  You can explicitly specify the
location of the python interpreter to use, using the PYTHON
configuration variable like this:

        ./configure PYTHON=/opt/local/bin/python3

   If you have the Closure Library source code installed, you can
configure JvJsDoc with the '--with-closure-library' option, to include
the Closure Libary documentation:

        ./configure --with-closure-library=DIR

Here, DIR should be the directory which contains the
"closure/goog/deps.js" file and the "closure/bin/build/" directory.
This configuration option enables the '-g' option of JvJsDoc.


USAGE WITHOUT INSTALLATION
==========================

   For easier experimenting, JvJsDoc can be used without installation.
To do so, unpack the source somewhere and then run JsJsDoc as
"./jvjsdoc.py" from inside the source directory (note the trailing
".py") in the command name.  You may need to adjust the name of the
python interpreter given in the first line of the "./jvjsdoc.py"
script in order for this to work.


JvJsDoc USAGE
=============

   Information about all command line options can be found by running
the command "jvjsdoc -h".  Basic usage is

        jvjsdoc -o htmldir jsdir1 jsdir2 ...

This recursively reads all javascript files found in the given
directories jsdir1, jsdir2, ... and extract all JSDoc tags.  The tags
are used to construct HTML files which are placed underneath the
'htmldir' directory (which is created if necessary).  A good starting
point for the generated documentation is the output file
"htmldir/index.html".
